# Error Handling
The purpose of this smart contract is to create a simple mechanism to manage a value that can be set and incremented only by the contract owner.

# Description
In my project, I created a simple Solidity smart contract named SimpleContract to demonstrate basic error handling using require(), assert(), and revert() statements. The contract maintains a value that can be set and incremented by the contract owner. The require statement is used to ensure that only the owner, whose address is stored during contract deployment, can set the value. The assert statement verifies that any increment value is positive. Finally, the revert statement prevents overflow errors by checking if the new value would exceed the maximum allowable value.
